# Patient-Health-Monitoring-System
The system's goal is to build a health monitoring system that can quickly measure a variety of health factors. The system's structure is depicted in the Circuit Diagram. Here, patients will measure their pulse rate and SpO2 using the max30100 sensor and patients can see measurement data in the LCD display. The data will be shown in the LCD Display. From there the patients can view the measurement of the health parameters. After measuring the physiological vital data of the human body, it will be sent to the Arduino UNO, which will process the analog data into digital. After that, the Measured data from the human body can be seen on the LCD display as well.
